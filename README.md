# Abba
Abba is a simple REST API helps homeowners or prospective owners predict  potential AirBnB rental income for one or more spare bedrooms.

## Description
Abba is a a RESTful API that uses full CRUD operations to allow clients to perform a http requests on a variety of routes. *For more route information check out the* **[wiki](https://github.com/adamstelle/abba/wiki)**.

### Why this should exist
With home prices constantly on the rise, home ownership is a huge financial burden on most first-time homeowners. Even for people making good wages, the prospect of adding huge monthly mortgage payments to the all-too-common  student loan or consumer debt is daunting. However, the rise of short-term rental sites like AirBnB now allow for homeowners to rent out one or more spare bedrooms and use the income to lessen their debt burden. The problem is that, until now, the income potential for AirBnBing small bedrooms has been hard to quantify.

That's why we created this tool: using historical data we can predict the monthly rental income potential for homeowners or prospective buyers based on a given address and some basic facts about the property.
